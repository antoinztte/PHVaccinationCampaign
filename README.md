# PH7 - Vaccination Campaign for the Philippines

With mask mandates lifted, vaccination efforts thriving, and most American families finally leaving their house to take that trip they were unable to take for over a year, countries and populations around the world with fewer resources and poorer healthcare access do not share in the same privileges.

The Philippines is struggling - it is among the Asian countries most affected by Covid-19 yet has one of the lowest vaccination rates. It has recorded more than 1.6 million infections, the second-highest in Southeast Asia. Current vaccination efforts and campaigns do not cater well to the confusion and mistrust of the more significant population. Having undergone a prior disastrous vaccination effort for Dengue Fever, Filipinos are hesitant in vaccines and have lost trust in their government and health officials. President Duterte has turned to force and threat (of imprisonment and death) - further dissuading populations and failing to reassure the masses. The few individuals willing to get vaccinated are unable to due to a lack of resources and a slow rollout in the country. Low vaccination rates also contribute to an economic crisis as the Philippines is a leading global producer of seafarers and agriculture.
